# Ansible playbook that deploys Hashicorp Vault

# Summary

This playbook deploys the HashiCorp Vault as well as HashiCorp Consul helm charts to your kubernetes cluster that is pointed at by your `~/.kube/config` file.
This file can be changes to any other file that is in your `~/.kube/` directory by adjusting the values in `stages/host_vars/localhost.yaml`
The playbook creates a vault namespace if neccessary.
The name of the release as well as the target namespace can be changed in the same `localhost.yaml` file.
You get three Vault pods for high availability (not configurable).

Afterwards your vault is initialized and unsealed and the root token as well as the unseal keys are saved in `stages/secrets/cluster_keys.json`

Then these stages are run:
    - apply all policies found under `stages/policies` the filenames define the policy name
    - configure JWT and enforce policy ACL mapping, meaning, if your Keycloak user does not have the same client role as the <policy>.hcl, they are not granted that policy access when trying to login with the role <policy>
    - the same happens with the OIDC role mapping. Your user tries to login with a role which is the policy name. Vault checks their client roles in order to grant access with the corresponding policy.
    - afterwards an internal group is created for every policy file with the corresponding name of the file without the hcl extension.
    - the secrets engine is configured and enabled. An example secret is the created.
    - the PKI engine is configured (and certificates are imported) and a role is created for every HCL policy that contains pki (case insensitive) in its file name.
    - the SSH engine is configured and the root public/private keys are imported. Also a role is created for every hcl policy that contains ssh (case insensitive).

## Requirements

- docker
- docker-compose
- kubectl

# Setup

### Generate certificates and private/public keys
Execute `cd stages/secrets && make && cd ../..` in order to create certificates and private & public keys.

### Configure Keycloak
Open the file `cd stages/secrets && mv keycloak.yaml.example keycloak.yaml && vi keycloak.yaml && cd ../..`

## Configure kubectl
Open the file `vi stages/host_vars/localhost.yaml` and point the `kubeconfig` to your used config file that MUST be inside of the `~/.kube` directory. If your used kubeconfig is not in that directory, please move it in there and point the path inside of `localhost.yaml` to that file.

### Deploy Vault
Execute `make` for the first time. This will deploy the vault in the vault namespace

The ansible script automatically creates a kubectl port-forward which is then used to connect to the vault-0 container in order to execute the configuration steps.

You may alter the script and remove the port forwards and add a different address in the `localhost.yaml` file.


## User permissions

The keycloak is configured in the way that a user by default gets the default role assigned in the keycloak as well as in vault.
This role allows for some basic functionalities on a per user scope.

Now you can give your user the client role that maps to the corresponding access policy in vault.
E.g. the manager role has the manager policy and can edit secrets.
The reader role has the reader policy applied to it and that role cannot edit bu tonly see secrets.
